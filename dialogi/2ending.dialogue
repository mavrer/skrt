WHO KILLED LUCAS?
- Dante
	"The aroma of suspicion"
	You avoided the trap, but failed to uncover the truth.
	Lucas never returned.  
	The café gradually emptied — without him the atmosphere grew heavy, and the taste of coffee… bland. Eventually, the place closed for good.  
	Not every story ends happily. Sometimes all that’s left is an empty cup and a sense of longing.
- Caroline

- Pierce
	"Justice and espresso"
	The truth came out. We exposed Pierce and freed Lucas.  
	The café is alive again, and the smell of freshly ground coffee fills the air like old times. Lucas is back — along with his legendary coffee.  
	Welcome back, master!
