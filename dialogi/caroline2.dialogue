Caroline: [[You're still asking about Lucas?|Hi.]]
You: You seemed hesitant yesterday.
Caroline: I wasn’t sure I should talk. But lately… he seemed afraid.
- Ask for more
    You: Afraid of what?
    Caroline: I don’t know. Just this nervous energy, like he thought someone was following him.
    It’s hard to explain.

    You: Maybe he was just stressed.
    Caroline: Or he was in trouble. I have a bad feeling about all this.
