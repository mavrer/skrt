Henry: [[Coffee’s better today.|Hey.]]
You: Thanks! Still learning the ropes.
Henry: You’re doing fine.
- Ask about Lucas
	You: Did you ever talk to Lucas?
	Henry: Not much. I worked here only a short time.
	He was... intense. Obsessed with the coffee. Like it was more than just a drink to him.
	Lately, he was rushing out. Looked like he was avoiding someone.
	You: Any idea who?
	Henry: No clue. Maybe his ex? Everyone runs from someone.
- Skip topic
	You: Glad to see a familiar face today.
	Henry: And I’m glad my flat white’s not burnt.
