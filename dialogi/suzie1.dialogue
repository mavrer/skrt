Suzie: [[You’re new here, right?|Hi there.]]
You: Yes, first day.
Suzie: Welcome then. Hope you survive the chaos here.
- Ask about Lucas
	You: Did you know Lucas?
	Suzie: Hmm… Lucas had a very interesting face.
	I sketched him a few times. He was quiet, but his eyes... said something else.
	Maybe he had secrets? Artists can tell — people aren’t always what they seem.
	You: That’s... cryptic.
- Don’t ask
	You: Thanks, I’ll do my best.
