Caroline: [[Still asking about Lucas?|Hello.]]
You: Did he say anything before he vanished?
Caroline: He was acting strange lately.
- Press her
	You: Strange how?
	Caroline: Like he wanted to tell me something... but he never got the chance.
	Someone interrupted us, and then he was just... gone.
- Be polite
	You: Maybe he had something personal going on.
	Caroline: Or something he couldn't talk about. Either way, it didnâ€™t feel right.
