Ezequiel: [[One coffee, please.|Hey.]]
You: Do you come here often?
Ezequiel: Not really.
- Ask about the reason
    You: What do you think happened to Lucass?
    Ezequiel: (pauses, takes a sip) I don’t know... maybe someone took him.  
    Someone who *couldn’t live without his coffee.*
- Make a joke
    You: His coffee *was* addictive.
    Ezequiel: (nods slowly) And addiction drives people to do strange things.
