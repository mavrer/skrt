Freya: [[Ah, a new face.|Hi.]]
You: Welcome back!
Freya: Lucas always asked how I felt. Sweet guy.
- Ask more
	You: Do you remember anything unusual recently?
	Freya: Few days ago I saw him rushing out. Like he was avoiding someone…
	You: That’s suspicious.
	Freya: I thought so too.
- Keep it casual
	You: I’ll be sure to keep the tradition and ask how you feel next time.
