Marcus: [[It's you again!|Morning.]]
You: I’m starting to like this job.
Marcus: If you stay long, you’ll see this place has its secrets.
- Ask about Lucas
	You: Yesterday you said Lucas might’ve had enemies?
	Marcus: Not enemies… but he had tense relations with some clients.
	He was always professional — but something tells me this wasn’t just a sudden walkout.
- Stay casual
	You: Just hoping for a quiet shift today.
	Marcus: Then don’t look too deep. You might not like what you find.
